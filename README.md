# Guillen-Number-Project
Website Link: https://guillen-numbers.cyclic.app/

The Guillen Number is a useful baseball stat that is defined as the percentage of RBI's a team has scored via the Home Run. It is often very difficult to calculate by hand and not easily obtained anywhere. This is because the number of RBIs for each homer can be 1-4, and there can be many homers during a team's full season. This website simply displays all current teams guillen-numbers and is updated daily.

Example Calculation: A team has a total of 580 RBIs and 322 of them have come via Homers. The guillen number for that team would be: (322/580) * 100  = %55.52.

The data for this project is stored is through cyclic's file system. The approach taken regarding how the data is updated daily is due to restrictions on Cyclic's free website plan.
